# ✅ To-Do List Web App  
**Task 2 – Web Development Internship**

This project is a simple, clean, and fully functional **To-Do List Web Application** built using **HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript**.  
It allows users to:
- Add tasks  
- Mark tasks as complete / incomplete  
- Delete tasks  
- View real-time task count  
- Interact instantly without page reload  

This task helped me understand DOM manipulation, event handling, and building functional UI components.
